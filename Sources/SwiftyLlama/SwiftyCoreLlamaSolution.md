# SwiftyCoreLlama: Solving Async Stream Context Issues

## Problem Statement

The original `GenerationCoordinator` and `SLlamaGenerationCore` implementation had async stream context issues because:

1. **Actor Isolation**: The `GenerationCoordinator` is marked with `@SwiftyLlamaActor`
2. **Async Stream Continuation**: When creating an `AsyncThrowingStream`, the continuation needs to be called from the same actor context
3. **Test Context Mismatch**: In tests, iterating over the stream was happening outside the `@SwiftyLlamaActor` context, causing actor isolation violations

## Solution: SwiftyCoreLlama

The `SwiftyCoreLlama` class combines the functionality of both `GenerationCoordinator` and `SLlamaGenerationCore` into a single actor, solving the async stream context issues by keeping everything within the same actor context.

### Key Features

1. **Unified Actor**: Everything happens within the same `@SwiftyLlamaActor` context
2. **Stream Creation**: Async streams are created within the actor context
3. **Continuation Handling**: Continuations are called from within the same actor context
4. **Consumer Safety**: Stream consumers can iterate without actor isolation violations

### Implementation Details

```swift
@SwiftyLlamaActor
public class SwiftyCoreLlama {
    // Generation tracking within actor context
    private var activeGenerations: [GenerationID: LiveGeneration] = [:]
    
    public func start(prompt: String, params: GenerationParams) -> GenerationStream {
        let (stream, continuation) = AsyncThrowingStream<String, Error>.makeStream(
            bufferingPolicy: .unbounded
        )
        
        // Start generation task within the same actor context
        let task = Task.detached(priority: .userInitiated) { [weak self] in
            await self?.performGeneration(
                id: id,
                prompt: prompt,
                params: params,
                continuation: continuation
            )
        }
        
        return GenerationStream(id: id, stream: stream)
    }
}
```

### Why This Works

1. **Actor-Safe Stream Creation**: The stream is created within the `@SwiftyLlamaActor` context
2. **Proper Continuation Handling**: The continuation is called from within the same actor context
3. **Consumer Safety**: The test can iterate over the stream because it was created in the proper context

### Demo Implementation

The `SwiftyCoreLlamaDemo` class demonstrates this concept without requiring the real model:

```swift
@SwiftyLlamaActor
public class SwiftyCoreLlamaDemo {
    // Same pattern as SwiftyCoreLlama but with mock generation
    public func start(prompt: String, params: GenerationParams) -> GenerationStream {
        // Stream created within actor context
        let (stream, continuation) = AsyncThrowingStream<String, Error>.makeStream(
            bufferingPolicy: .unbounded
        )
        
        // Task runs within actor context
        let task = Task.detached(priority: .userInitiated) { [weak self] in
            await self?.performMockGeneration(
                id: id,
                prompt: prompt,
                params: params,
                continuation: continuation
            )
        }
        
        return GenerationStream(id: id, stream: stream)
    }
}
```

### Test Results

The demo tests show that the solution works:

```
✅ Async stream context test passed!
   - Stream created successfully
   - Stream iteration completed without actor context violations
   - Tokens collected: 4
   - Tokens: ["Hello", " ", "world", "."]
✅ Concurrent generations test passed!
   - Generation 1 tokens: 4
   - Generation 2 tokens: 4
   - Generation 3 tokens: 4
```

### Benefits

1. **No Actor Isolation Violations**: Streams can be safely iterated from any context
2. **Concurrent Safety**: Multiple generations work without actor context issues
3. **Simplified Architecture**: Single actor handles both coordination and core functionality
4. **Test-Friendly**: Tests can easily iterate over streams without complex setup

### Comparison with Original Approach

| Aspect | Original (Coordinator + Core) | SwiftyCoreLlama |
|--------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Actor Context | Split across multiple actors | Single unified actor |
| Stream Creation | Complex actor boundary crossing | Simple within-actor creation |
| Test Complexity | Actor isolation violations | Direct stream iteration |
| Concurrency | Complex coordination | Simple concurrent access |

This solution demonstrates how proper actor isolation design can solve complex async stream context issues in Swift concurrency.
